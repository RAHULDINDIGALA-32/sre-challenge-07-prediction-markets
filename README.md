# sre-challenge-07-prediction-markets
This repo contains my implementation of SpeedRunEthereum Challenge 07 - Prediction Market. The project builds a decentralized prediction market using a dual-token model, AMM-based pricing, oracle resolution, liquidity provisioning, and winner-takes-all payouts - implemented with Solidity, Hardhat, and Scaffold-ETH 2.
